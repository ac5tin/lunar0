This field could be helpful to upper level controllers(i.e., application controller) to decide whether they should continue on waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error reported. The snapshot controller will keep retrying when an error occurrs during the snapshot creation. Upon success, this error field will be cleared.

For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail.
